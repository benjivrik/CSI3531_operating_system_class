# Operating System Class

CSI3531 : Syst√®me d'exploitation | CSI3131 : Operating System | University of Ottawa  

These are the solutions of the homework 2, 3 and 4. 

# The theoritical answers are not given in this repository and will not be given to you. 

I will not post the questions as well. Simply because they belong to the University of Ottawa. 
I am only posting the codes I submitted. 


Here is the feedback I received for each of homework :

Homework 1 ( Process ): 82/100 

Homework 2 ( Threading with Java ): 100/100 

Homework 3 ( The Sleeping Teaching Assistant ): 100/100 

Homework 4 ( Shared Memory between program in c - Python implementation of page replacement algorithms LRU and FIFO ): 100/100

# Beware of Copy Pasting these codes  :D. 

I am posting the code I submitted because It was a great experience to follow this class
during the term. 

And it is was a great experience to learn the new concepts of processes, threadings, mutexes or page replacement algorithms.

The solutions are pretty similar. 

# Make your own code, find your own mistakes, customize your code and learn!
